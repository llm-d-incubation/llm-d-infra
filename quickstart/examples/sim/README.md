# Feature: llm-d Simulation

## Overview

This is a simulation example that demonstrates how to deploy using the llm-d-infra system with the `ghcr.io/llm-d/llm-d-inference-sim` image. This example simulates inference responses and can run on minimal resources without requiring actual GPU hardware.

## Pre-requisites

- It is assumed that you have the proper tools installed on your local system to use these quickstart. To see what those tools are and minimum versions, check [our docs](../../dependencies/README.md#required-tools), and to install them, see our [install-deps.sh](../../dependencies/install-deps.sh) script.

- Additionally, it is assumed you have configured and deployed your Gateway Control Plane, and their pre-requisite CRDs. For information on this see the [gateway-control-plane-providers](../../gateway-control-plane-providers/) directory.

**_NOTE:_** Unlike other examples which require models, the simulator stubs the vLLM server and so no HuggingFace token is needed.

## Installation

Use the helmfile to compose and install the stack. The Namespace in which the stack will be deployed will be derived from the `${NAMESPACE}` environment variable. If you have not set this, it will default to `llm-d-sim` in this example.

```bash
export NAMESPACE=llm-d-sim # Or any namespace your heart desires
cd quickstart/examples/sim
helmfile apply -n ${NAMESPACE}
```

**_NOTE:_** You can set the `$RELEASE_NAME_POSTFIX` env variable to change the release names. This is how we support concurrent installs. ex: `RELEASE_NAME_POSTFIX=sim-2 helmfile apply -n ${NAMESPACE}`

**_NOTE:_** This uses Istio as the default provider, see [Gateway Options](./README.md#gateway-options) for installing with a specific provider.

### Gateway options

To see specify your gateway choice you can use the `-e <gateway option>` flag, ex:

```bash
helmfile apply -e kgateway -n ${NAMESPACE}
```

To see what gateway options are supported refer to our [gateway control plane docs](../../gateway-control-plane-providers/README.md#supported-providers). Gateway configurations per provider are tracked in the [gateway-configurations directory](../common/gateway-configurations/).

You can also customize your gateway, for more information on how to do that see our [gateway customization docs](../../docs/customizing-your-gateway.md).

## Verify the Installation

- Firstly, you should be able to list all helm releases to view the 3 charts got installed into your chosen namespace:

```bash
helm list -n ${NAMESPACE}
NAME        NAMESPACE   REVISION   UPDATED                               STATUS     CHART                       APP VERSION
gaie-sim    llm-d-sim   1          2025-08-24 11:44:26.88254 -0700 PDT   deployed   inferencepool-v0.5.1        v0.5.1
infra-sim   llm-d-sim   1          2025-08-24 11:44:23.11688 -0700 PDT   deployed   llm-d-infra-v1.3.0          v0.3.0
ms-sim      llm-d-sim   1          2025-08-24 11:44:32.17112 -0700 PDT   deployed   llm-d-modelservice-v0.2.7   v0.2.0
```

- Out of the box with this example you should have the following resources:

```bash
kubectl get all -n ${NAMESPACE}

```

**_NOTE:_** This assumes no other quickstart deployments in your given `${NAMESPACE}`.

## Using the stack

For instructions on getting started making inference requests see [our docs](../../docs/getting-started-inferencing.md)

## Cleanup

To remove the deployment:

```bash
# From examples/sim
helmfile destroy -n ${NAMESPACE}

# Or uninstall manually
helm uninstall infra-sim -n ${NAMESPACE}
helm uninstall gaie-sim -n ${NAMESPACE}
helm uninstall ms-sim -n ${NAMESPACE}
```

**_NOTE:_** If you set the `$RELEASE_NAME_POSTFIX` environment variable, your release names will be different from the command above: `infra-$RELEASE_NAME_POSTFIX`, `gaie-$RELEASE_NAME_POSTFIX` and `ms-$RELEASE_NAME_POSTFIX`.

**_NOTE:_** You do not need to specify your `environment` with the `-e <environment>` flag to `helmfile` for removing a installation of the quickstart, even if you use a non-default option. You do, however, have to set the `-n ${NAMESPACE}` otherwise it may not cleanup the releases in the proper namespace.

## Customization

For information on customizing an installation of a quickstart path and tips to build your own, see [our docs](../../docs/customizing-a-quickstart-inference-stack.md)
